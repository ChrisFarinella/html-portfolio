<h1>The Best Movies According to Chris</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>This is probably Quentin Tarantino's best movie to date.  It is pretty good.</p>
<h3>Barbarian</h3>
<p>This is the best horror movie that I've seen in a while.  Keeps you guessing at every turn.</p>
<h3>Dragon Ball Super: Broly</h3>
<p>This is by far the best Dragon Ball movie that has been made so far.  The animation is top notch.</p>
